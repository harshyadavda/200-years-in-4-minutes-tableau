## 📌 Project Overview

This project is inspired by **Hans Rosling’s legendary talk “200 Years in 4 Minutes”**, where he shows how countries have evolved over time in terms of income and life expectancy.

The goal of this project was not just to recreate a famous visualization, but to **understand how data can tell a powerful story** when time, motion, and context come together. Using **Tableau**, I recreated the core idea of the animation and focused on making the insights intuitive and engaging for the viewer.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

While many dashboards show static numbers, this project focuses on change over time.

Through this visualization, I wanted to explore:

- How countries progressed over 200 years.

- The relationship between **income, life expectancy, and population**.

- How animated visuals can make complex global trends easy to understand.

This project helped me think beyond charts and focus on what the data is actually saying.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Tableau** – for data visualization and animation

- **Historical country-level data** – income, life expectancy, population

## 📊 Visualization Highlights

- Animated scatter plot showing **life expectancy vs income**.

- Time progression across years to reflect long-term development.

- Bubble size representing **population**.

- Clear storytelling inspired by Hans Rosling’s original concept.

The emphasis was on clarity and flow, so even someone unfamiliar with the data can understand the trend.

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Data storytelling is as important as technical skills.

- Animations can reveal insights that static charts often hide.

- Asking the right question matters more than adding more visuals.

- A simple, well-thought-out design is more impactful than a complex one.

## 📌 Inspiration & Credits

This project is inspired by **Hans Rosling’s “200 Years in 4 Minutes”**, which remains one of the best examples of data storytelling in action.
This visualization was created primarily to explore and understand the **animation capabilities in Tableau**, and to see how intuitively time-based motion can be implemented compared to Power BI. The project helped me understand how easily Tableau handles animated storytelling when working with historical data.
